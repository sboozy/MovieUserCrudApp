#AKA MovieMinder AKA FilmFile AKA this name is a WIP  
  
##IDEA  
I watch a ton of movies - good, bad... I really don't descriminate.  And many times I have found myself starting a movie, only to get 20 minutes into it and realize I have definitely seen this movie before. So here is where this app comes in.  
  
##OVERVIEW  
This is an app where a user logs in and makes entries on movies they have seen, with the ability to rate that movie (1 to 5 stars), can view all the movies they have seen, can edit their previous entries or delete an entire entry ( you know, maybe if they decide they no longer want all their friends to know how much they enjoyed Twilight)  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

-Authenting a user and saving a session  
-Leaving myself enough time to make this thing pretty
